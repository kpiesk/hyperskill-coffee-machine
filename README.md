# hyperskill-coffee-machine
### My Coffee Machine project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course.

**Project Number:** #6

**About:** A coffee machine simulator which allows the user to buy three types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. The coffee machine has typical resources such as water, milk, coffee beans, and cups. The user also has to pay money for each type of coffee, therefore, the coffee machine also collects money. The coffee machine has the capacity to check whether there are enough resources to make the coffee for the user, therefore, if the coffee machine runs out of something, it displays a notification. Special workers can fill out the supplies for the coffee machine, or take out all of the money collected by the coffee machine. The user can always check the current status (available resources) of the coffee machine. To make the coffee simulator more realistic, it is always turned on unless the user chooses to turn it off by typing 'exit'.

**Learning Outcomes:** Along with doing the project itself and finding solutions to numerous problems, I was learning more about Python syntax and became more confident in working with functions, loops, conditions and user input. I learnt to utilize classes and methods in Python, and gained knowledge of the magic methods (dunders), and the differences between instance attributes and class attributes. This project also allowed me to use my skills of computational thinking, planning and developing a more complex program from scratch and slowly adding more functionality.
